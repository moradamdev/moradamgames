            <h1>Hey, it's me, Adam</h1>
            <h3>Sometimes I go by Mora</h3>
            <p>I hope you're enjoying my website, I made it because I wanted a place to show all the games I've created.</p>
            <p>I'm also studying to be a web developer, so it doubles as two portfolios!</p>
            <h3>Anyways...</h3>
            <p>I started making games back in 2017 because I was really tired of living a boring life.</p>
            <p>I made my first game, Ochen, when I was 17 and I've been making games ever since.</p>
            <p>A lot of these games are just for fun, some are just arcade type games, but Ochen, and my current project, Spider's Thread (working title) are a lot more than just an arcade game.</p>
            <p>Spider's Thread is coming along nicely, it's based off of the short story of the same name by Akutagawa. Please go read that as well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanna make games that can make you feel some type of emotion. I don't know what that emotion is yet, but I'm sure it will be different for everyone.</p>

            <p>Welp, that's it from me, for now at least. </p>
            <p>In the meantime, go follow my twitter. I might update you there on the games I'm working on.</p>
